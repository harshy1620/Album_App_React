# React Album Management App

This React-based album management app allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on albums. It uses React hooks for state management, React Router for navigation, and fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).

## Features

1. **Fetch Albums**: Fetch and display albums from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).

2. **Add Album**: Add a new album by making a POST request to the same API and saving the album in the React state. Please note that this is a dummy request and won't add albums to the server, but it demonstrates a valid POST operation.

3. **Update Album**: Update an existing album by making a PUT request to the API. This is a dummy call as the API doesn't support actual updates, but it showcases the update functionality in the app.

4. **Delete Album**: Delete an album by making a DELETE request to the API. Similar to the other operations, this is a dummy call as the API doesn't support actual deletions, but it demonstrates the delete feature.
